1. 1. **Define Test Scope and Objectives**: Identify the key email functionalities to be tested, such as email delivery, formatting, and basic interactions. Establish the criteria for a successful test to ensure the essential components are verified
2. 2. **Set Up Test Environment**: Prepare the necessary test environment, including SMTP server configurations, test email accounts, and any email client applications required to verify the email functionalities
3. 3. **Create and Configure Test Cases**: Develop a set of test cases covering the basic scenarios you wish to validate. This may include sending emails, receiving emails, checking email headers, and verifying attachments
4. 4. **Execute Test Cases**: Conduct the email smoke test by executing the previously configured test cases. Send and receive test emails, and verify if they meet predefined expectations
5. 5. **Analyze and Report Results**: Review the outcomes of the tests, identifying any issues related to email delivery or expected email features. Document the results and any deviations from expected outcomes, noting potential areas for improvement
6. 6. **Implement Fixes and Retest if Necessary**: If any issues were identified during testing, collaborate with the development team to implement necessary fixes. Perform subsequent tests to confirm that issues are resolved and functionalities are working as expected
